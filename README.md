SpoofyBoisTester: An IPv4 Header Modification Testing Tool (IP Spoofing Test)

Test your server's ability to spoof packets with this simple script. Avoid using other tools and services that potentially harass your provider by using this script! Don't use other popular tools like [Caida's spoofer tool] - these have been rumored to threaten upstreams and providers about spoofing and force them to change their policies and stop allowing spoofing. 

Requirements:
Python2.7
Scapy (https://scapy.net/)
